## Contributing

  * Fork Gwen on http://github.com/badlogic/gwen
  * Hack away and send a pull request on Github!

### Formatter ###

Please use the standard Kotlin formatter in IntelliJ IDEA or the one that comes with the Kotlin Eclipse plugin. Failure to apply the formatter will result in closed pull requests.

### Code Style ###

Gwen does not have an official coding standard. We mostly follow the usual Kotlin style, and so should you.

A few things we'd rather not like to see:

  * underscores in any kind of identifier
  * [Hungarian notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation)
  * Prefixes for fields or arguments
  * Curly braces on new lines

If you modify an existing file, follow the style of the code in there. Curly braces may be omitted if it does not hurt readability.

If you create a new file, make sure to add the license header.

### Git ###

We'd kindly ask you to keep your pull requests small if possible. A change-set of 3000 files is likely not to get merged.

We may reject your pull requests to master if we do not deem them to be ready or fitting. Please don't take offense in that case. Gwen is a personal project for the most part, and thus serves our needs first and foremost.
